# Launcher Window

This page documents how to customize the Vicinae launcher window. If you are looking for ways to programatically control the window, consider using [deeplinks](/deeplinks#window-controls). {{ className: 'lead' }}


## Window sizing

For now it is not possible to change window dimensions. If you really need this, feel free to create a <a href={FEATURE_REQUEST_URL}>feature request</a>.

## Hyprland blur

All you need are the following layer rules in your Hyprland config:

```bash
layerrule = blur,vicinae
layerrule = ignorealpha 0, vicinae
```

You also need to make sure the window opacity is less than `1.0` in the Vicinae settings. It should default to a slightly transparent value.

## Window scaling

It is possible to enable window scaling for Vicinae by setting the `QT_SCALE_FACTOR` environment variable to an appropriate value:

```bash
QT_SCALE_FACTOR=1.5 vicinae server
```

<Note>
It is not recommended to set this value globally as it will force scaling for every QT app. If you need desktop-wide scaling you probably want your Wayland compositor to handle this for you. Only use this if you only need the Vicinae window to scale up or down.
</Note>

## Font size

It is possible to change the base font size from within the <a href={VICINAE_GENERAL_SETTINGS_URL}>settings</a>.
