# Extensions

Vicinae can be extended using React and Typescript in order to build rich lists, grids, or even render plain markdown.

This page explains how to install and run extensions. If you are looking to build your own extensions or learn more about the extension system, please refer to the [extension section](/extensions/introduction) of this documentation.

## Install from source tree

This assumes you have downloaded an extension's source code from somewhere on the Internet (e.g GitHub). 

From the extension's source tree, simply run:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

After it's built, you should be able to search for commands exported by this extension.
No server restart should be required.

<Note>
For now we don't provide a centralized store to discover extensions, except for the Raycast ones (see below) where we use the official Raycast store. 
</Note>

## Raycast Extensions

You can install Raycast extensions published to the official Raycast store in one click from within Vicinae:

Launch the [Raycast Store](vicinae://extensions/vicinae/raycast-compat/store) command, search for the extension you are looking for, click on details and then install.

Vicinae will then download the extension from Raycast's servers and install it right away, making it immediately available from the root search.

<Warning>
Extension support is very bare-bones at the moment, and most extensions will not work because of missing APIs or hardcoded MacOS stuff.
This is being worked on actively and will improve significantly in the future.
</Warning>

## Uninstall extension

You can uninstall an extension from the root search by searching for the "Uninstall Extension" action:
