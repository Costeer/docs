# Operating System Support

Vicinae will eventually support all major operating systems but is currently focusing on Linux:

| Name | Supported | Comment |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Linux Wayland | ✅ | Primary development target, recommended |
| Linux X11 | ✅ | Generally less polished than its Wayland counterpart |
| MacOS | ❌ | Planned, no ETA (before Windows) |
| Windows | ❌ | Planned, no ETA |
| Mobile things | ❌ | Not planned |
