# Fallback Commands

This page explains how to deal with fallback commands in Vicinae.

## Introduction

Fallback commands are commands that will be shown at the very bottom of the root search when no better matches are available for the current query.

Unlike regular commands, fallback commands will directly work with the provided query as their input. 
A fallback command  is usually either a launcher command (view or no view) or an application shortcut.

## Fallback command behaviour

A fallback command will act slightly differently depending on its item type:

- A *view* command will be launched and have its search text immediately set to the fallback text. If the view type does not support search, no completion happens. 
- A shortcut or *no-view* command will be launched with the search query passed as its first argument

## Set fallback commands

You can use the [Manage fallback commands](vicinae://extensions/vicinae/vicinae/manage-fallback) command to select what commands or shortcuts are eligible to be fallback commands.

You may have noticed that not all commands and shortcuts appear in this list: fallback eligibility follows these rules:

- All *view* commands exported by third-party extensions can be selected as fallback
- Shortcuts or *no-view* commands that take exactly one **text** argument (required or optional) can be selected as fallback
- Select built-in commands (such as `Search Files`) can be selected as fallback, but most don't
