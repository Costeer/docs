# Getting started

The `vicinae` binary should be installed on your system.

To start the vicinae daemon, simply run:

```bash {{ title: 'Start daemon' }}
vicinae server
```

If you prefer systemd service, run:

```bash {{ title: 'Start systemd service' }}
systemctl enable --now --user vicinae.service
```

Starting the daemon can take up to a few seconds when doing so for the very first time. 

Once the server is started, you can run `vicinae` again without an argument to make the Vicinae launcher window appear:

<img src="/vicinae-window.webp" />

To toggle the window visiblity, you can just run `vicinae` again or use [deeplinks](/deeplinks).

Vicinae doesn't deal with system keyboard shortcuts itself because every environment does it differently, so it's up to you to setup proper bindings.
