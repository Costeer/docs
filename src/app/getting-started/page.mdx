# Getting started

The `vicinae` binary should be installed on your system.

To start the vicinae server, simply run:

```bash {{ title: 'Start server' }}
vicinae server
```

If you prefer systemd service, run:

```bash {{ title: 'Start systemd service' }}
systemctl enable --now --user vicinae.service
```

Starting the server can take up to a few seconds when doing so for the very first time. 

Once the server is started, you can run `vicinae toggle` to toggle the vicinae window.

For more advanced controls, you should look into [deeplinks](/deeplinks).

Vicinae doesn't deal with system keyboard shortcuts itself because every environment does it differently, so it's up to you to setup proper bindings.
