# Getting started

The `vicinae` binary should be installed on your system.

To start the vicinae server, simply run:

```bash
vicinae server
```

Or as a systemd user service:

```bash
systemctl enable --now --user vicinae.service
```

<Warning>
If running Vicinae through systemd, please ensure you are starting your compositor as a systemd service, for example with `uwsm`.
If you don't, some environment variables may not be properly set and launching some apps may not work.
</Warning>

Starting the server can take up to a few seconds when doing so for the very first time. 

Once the server is started, you can run `vicinae toggle` to toggle the vicinae window.

For more advanced controls, you should look into [deeplinks](/deeplinks).

Vicinae doesn't deal with system keyboard shortcuts itself because every environment does it differently, so it's up to you to setup proper bindings.
