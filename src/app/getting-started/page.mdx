# Getting started

The `vicinae` binary should be installed on your system.

To start the vicinae daemon, simply run:

```bash {{ title: 'Start daemon' }}
vicinae server
```

If you prefer systemd service, run:

```bash {{ title: 'Start systemd service' }}
systemctl enable --now --user vicinae.service
```

Starting the daemon can take up to a few seconds when doing so for the very first time. 

Once the server is started, you can run `vicinae` again without an argument to make the Vicinae launcher window appear:

<img src="/vicinae-window.png" />

To toggle the window visiblity, you can just run `vicinae` again or use [deeplinks](/deeplinks).

Vicinae doesn't deal with system keyboard shortcuts itself because every environment does it differently, so it's up to you to setup proper bindings.

## Gnome Support

Gnome is supported via the [Vicinae Gnome Extension](https://github.com/dagimg-dot/vicinae-gnome-extension) which provides the following features:

- Expose clipboard events through dbus
- Expose window managment APIs through dbus
- Blocking specific applications from accessing the clipboard (like password managers)
- Imitate the layer-shell protocol to create a detached floating launcher window which closes on focus loss

### Installation

1. Download the `.shell-extension.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/dagimg-dot/vicinae-gnome-extension/releases/latest)
2. Install using: `gnome-extensions install --force <filename>`
3. Enable the extension in GNOME Extensions app
4. Restart GNOME Shell or log out/in
5. Restart your vicinae server if it's running
