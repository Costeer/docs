# Vicinae

Vicinae (pronounced "vih-SIN-ay") is a high-performance, native launcher for Linux — built with C++ and Qt.

It ships with built-in modules and lets you build extensions using React and TypeScript, fully server-side — no browser or Electron needed.

This documentation is your go-to manual for using Vicinae and developing extensions for it.

## Contributing {{ anchor: false }}

As a system launcher, Vicinae plugs deep into operating systems internals. The freedom of Linux gives us a ton of possibilities, but it also means dealing with a lot of environments. 

That’s why Vicinae is built modular — so it’s easy to add support for new setups (and eventually, Windows and macOS).
The docs include detailed guides for key contributions — like adding support for a new window manager or clipboard server.

Even if you’re not a C++ wizard, you can still *totally* jump in. The guides are quite descriptive and C++ is actually not so hard to grasp.
