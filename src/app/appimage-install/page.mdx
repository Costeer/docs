# Install AppImage

Starting with version `v0.10.0` we now distribute vicinae as an AppImage. 
The AppImage release is meant for users that run older systems, don't have vicinae packaged for their distribution, or can't compile it from source.

## Requirements

You need `fuse` installed on your system in order to run AppImages in general. You may also need to install `libqalculate` in order to get working currency conversion.

## Get AppImage

Download the AppImage from the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/vicinaehq/vicinae/releases).
You are looking for the file ending with `.AppImage`.

## Run AppImage

Make the AppImage executable, and then simply run it as you would run the regular `vicinae` binary:

```bash
chmod +x Vicinae-c5d11870-x86_64.AppImage
./Vicinae-c5d11870-x86_64.AppImage server
```

And with that, you should be good to go!

## Known caveats

- On some distributions, vicinae seems to be unable to connect to the proper system keyring and fails to write the clipboard history encryption key, resulting in a non functional clipboard history.
If this happens to you feel free to open an issue.
