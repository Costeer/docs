# Favicon Loading

By default, Vicinae will use favicons to provide rich integration with remote URLs.

## Favicon provider

By default, we use the [Twenty](https://github.com/twentyhq/favicon) favicon provider to load and then cache favicons.

You can change the provider used to fetch favicons or disable favicon loading entirely from the settings.
