# Generic Quickstart

Desktop-agnostic quickstart instructions for Vicinae. If there is a dedicated quickstart guide for your desktop environment, use that instead for environment-specific optimizations.

## Start the server

To start the Vicinae server, simply run:

```bash
vicinae server
```

Or as a systemd user service:

```bash
systemctl --user enable --now vicinae.service
```

<Warning>
If running Vicinae through systemd, please ensure you are starting your compositor as a systemd service, for example with `uwsm`. If you don't, some environment variables may not be properly set and launching some apps may not work.
</Warning>

To view the server logs when using systemd:

```bash
journalctl --user -u vicinae
```

Starting the server can take up to a few seconds when doing so for the very first time.

<Note>
On first startup, Vicinae will use a lot of CPU to populate the file index.
</Note>

## Control the window

Once the server is started, you can run `vicinae toggle` to toggle the Vicinae window.

For more advanced controls, see the [deeplinks documentation](/deeplinks).

<Warning>
Vicinae doesn't support global shortcuts. You are expected to create keyboard shortcuts yourself using your desktop environment's settings.
</Warning>
