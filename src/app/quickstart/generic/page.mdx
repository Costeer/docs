# Quickstart

Desktop-agnostic quickstart instructions. If there is a dedicated quickstart guide for your environment, read that instead. Also, feel free to contribute a quickstart guide for your environment! {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Start the server

To start the vicinae server, simply run:

```bash
vicinae server
```

Or as a systemd user service:

```bash
systemctl enable --now --user vicinae.service
```

<Warning>
If running Vicinae through systemd, please ensure you are starting your compositor as a systemd service, for example with `uwsm`.
If you don't, some environment variables may not be properly set and launching some apps may not work.
</Warning>

Starting the server can take up to a few seconds when doing so for the very first time. 

<Note>
On first startup, Vicinae will use a lot of CPU in order to populate the file index.
</Note>

## Control the window

Once the server is started, you can run `vicinae toggle` to toggle the vicinae window.

For more advanced controls, you should look into [deeplinks](/deeplinks).

<Warning>
Vicinae doesn't support global shortcuts. You are expected to create keyboard shortcuts yourself.
</Warning>
