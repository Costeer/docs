# Installation

This guide will teach you how to install Vicinae on your Linux system, be it from an already built executable or by compiling the software from source. {{ className: 'lead' }}


## Runtime dependencies

The following dependencies must be installed regardless of your installation method. You will find the list of package to install for popular distributions below. If your distribution is not listed, you should normally be able to infer the package names you need from these lists. If you got it to work on your distribution, feel free to contribute your own package list!

<CodeGroup title="Install dependencies">
```bash {{ title: 'Arch Linux' }}
pacman -Syu			\
    nodejs			\
    qt6-base		\
    qt6-svg			\
    protobuf		\
    cmark-gfm		\
    layer-shell-qt 	\
    libqalculate 	\
    minizip			\
    qtkeychain-qt6	\
```

```bash {{ title: 'Fedora' }}
dnf install -y \

## Build from source (recommended)

Building from source is the recommended way to install Vicinae if you plan on contributing later on. The build process is being tested on rolling release distributions such as Gentoo or Arch. You may run into trouble compiling if you are using a distribution that has old package versions. 

### Build requirements

- A C++23-capable compiler (GCC is recommended; Clang should also work)
- `cmake`
- `rapidfuzz-cpp` (header only, so only needed at compile time)
- `libprotoc` — the Protocol Buffers compiler (different from the runtime `libprotobuf`)
- `npm` (any version bundled with Node.js ≥ 18 should work)

You can find the exact list of package to install for supported distributions below:

<CodeGroup title="Install dependencies">
```bash {{ title: 'Arch Linux' }}
pacman -Syu			\
    base-devel 		\
    cmake			\
    ninja			\
    nodejs			\
    npm				\
    qt6-base		\
    qt6-svg			\
    protobuf		\
    cmark-gfm		\
    layer-shell-qt 	\
    libqalculate 	\
    minizip			\
    qtkeychain-qt6	\
    rapidfuzz-cpp
```

```bash {{ title: 'Fedora' }}
dnf install -y \
    qt6-qtbase-devel \
    qt6-qtsvg-devel \
    qt6-qtbase-private-devel \
    qt6-qtwayland-devel \

    libstdc++-static \
    zlib-devel \
    zlib-static
```

```bash {{ title: 'Gentoo Linux' }}
emerge -av			\
	qtkeychain		\
	qtbase			\
	minizip-ng		\
	rapidfuzz-cpp	\
	layer-shell-qt	\
	libqalculate	\
	nodejs			\
	cmake			\
	cmark-gfm		\
	dev-qt/qtsvg	\
	protobuf		\
	dev-build/ninja
```

### Build

You can execute the following commands in order to compile a release build. You should expect the build process to take about 10 minutes on modern hardware.

```bash {{ title: 'Build commands' }}
cmake -G Ninja -B build
cmake --build build 
sudo cmake --install build
```

## Install from latest release

You can fetch the [latest release archive](https://github.com/vicinaehq/vicinae/releases), which contains:
- The compiled Vicinae binary
- A `.desktop` file (required for URL scheme support)

<Note>
Currently, the pre-built binary is dynamically linked to `libprotobuf` which upgrades quite often, and is generally not retro-compatible. If you are running an older system you will most likely run into an error when launching the binary. For now, the only workaround is to compile it from source.
