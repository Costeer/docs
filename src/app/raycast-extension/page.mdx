# Raycast Extension Support

Vicinae took great inspiration from the [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) launcher, especially when it comes to extensibility. For this reason, we offer compatibility with most existing Raycast extensions.

If you are looking to develop your own Vicinae extensions (very Raycast-like, mostly compatible) please refer to the [extension section](/extensions/introduction) of this documentation.

<Warning>
Extension support is very bare-bones at the moment, and most extensions will not work because of missing APIs or hardcoded MacOS stuff.
This is being worked on actively and will improve significantly in the future.
</Warning>

## Install Raycast Extensions

You can install any official Raycast extension published to the store in one click from within Vicinae.

Launch the [Raycast Store](vicinae://extensions/vicinae/raycast-compat/store) command, search for the extension you are looking for, click on details and then install.

Vicinae will then download the extension from Raycast's servers and install it right away, making it immediately available for use.
