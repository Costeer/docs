# CLI Tools

The `vicinae` binary provides command-line tools for managing, validating, and debugging theme files.

## Available Commands

Run the following to see all theme-related commands:

```bash
vicinae theme --help
```

This will display the available subcommands and their options.

## Generate Theme Template

Create a complete theme template with all available color keys and documentation:

```bash
vicinae theme template > ~/.local/share/vicinae/themes/my-new-theme.toml
```

This command outputs a template to stdout, which you can redirect to a file. The template includes:
- All available metadata fields
- Every color table and key
- Inline comments explaining each option
- Example values


## Validate and Lint Themes

Check a theme file for errors and potential issues:

```bash
vicinae theme check ~/.local/share/vicinae/themes/my-theme.toml
```

The check command will:
- Validate TOML syntax
- Verify required metadata fields
- Check for circular color references
- Warn about invalid color values
- Validate color reference paths


## Set Active Theme

Change the currently active theme from the command line:

```bash
vicinae theme set <theme_id>
```

The `theme_id` is the theme filename without the `.toml` extension. For example, if your theme file is named `catppuccin-mocha.toml`, use:

```bash
vicinae theme set catppuccin-mocha
```

## View Theme Search Paths

Display the directories where Vicinae looks for theme files:

```bash
vicinae theme paths
```

This command prints the search paths in order of precedence. Themes are loaded from these directories, and the first occurrence of a theme file takes precedence, effectively shadowing any theme with the same filename in lower-priority directories.

### Typical Search Paths

The paths usually follow the XDG Base Directory specification:

1. `$HOME/.local/share/vicinae/themes` (user themes)
2. `/usr/local/share/vicinae/themes` (system-wide themes)
3. `/usr/share/vicinae/themes` (distribution themes)

<Note>
It's recommended to place custom themes in `$HOME/.local/share/vicinae/themes` to avoid conflicts with system updates.
</Note>

### Theme Shadowing

If two themes have the same filename in different search paths, only the first one will be loaded. This allows you to override system themes with custom versions:

```
~/.local/share/vicinae/themes/rose-pine.toml  ← This one loads
/usr/share/vicinae/themes/rose-pine.toml      ← This one is shadowed
```

## Theme Directory Structure

Theme directories must be flat - subdirectories are not searched. All theme files should be placed directly in the theme directory:

```
Correct:
~/.local/share/vicinae/themes/
├── my-theme.toml
├── another-theme.toml
└── catppuccin-mocha.toml

Incorrect (subdirectories won't be found):
~/.local/share/vicinae/themes/
└── custom/
    └── my-theme.toml
```

However, theme assets (like icons) can be in subdirectories and referenced relatively:

```toml
[meta]
icon = "icons/my-theme-icon.png"
```

This will look for `icons/my-theme-icon.png` relative to the theme file's location.

Theme directories are automatically watched. Changes to theme files are applied immediately without restarting Vicinae.
