# Theming

Vicinae comes with its own theming system and **does not** integrate with your system theme for various reasons. Creating and switching themes, however, is simple and straightforward. This guide explains how to do both. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Default Themes

By default, Vicinae includes only two built-in themes: `Vicinae Light` and `Vicinae Dark`. Unlike third-party themes, these are not stored on the filesystem—they are embedded directly into every build.  

The dark theme is selected as the default, regardless of your environment.

## Changing the Current Theme

You can change the current theme in two main ways:

### 1. Using the "Set Theme" Command

The [Set Theme](vicinae://extensions/vicinae/theme/set) command is available directly from the root search. Activate it, then choose the theme you want to apply. The selected theme will persist across reboots.

### 2. Changing the Theme from Settings

You can also open the settings window and select your preferred theme. This works exactly the same way as the `Set Theme` command.

### 3. Using deeplink

See [here](/deeplinks#set-theme).

## Creating a Custom Theme

Creating a custom theme is simple: just provide a JSON file with your theme information. Here’s an example:

```json
{
	"version": "1.0.0",
	"appearance": "dark",
	"icon": "./catppuccin.png",
	"name": "Catppuccin Mocha",
	"description": "Soothing pastel colors for dark environments",
	"palette": {
	  "background": "#1E1E2E",
	  "foreground": "#CDD6F4",
	  "blue": "#89B4FA",
	  "green": "#A6E3A1",
	  "magenta": "#F5C2E7",
	  "orange": "#FAB387",
	  "purple": "#CBA6F7",
	  "red": "#F38BA8",
	  "yellow": "#F9E2AF",
	  "cyan": "#94E2D5"
	}
}
```

- The version field is not used at the moment but may become important in future updates. For now, use "1.0.0".
- The icon path is relative to the theme file. Only local paths are supported.
- Vicinae generates all necessary colors dynamically from the provided palette. Currently, semantic colors cannot be defined directly.

Place your theme files in `$HOME/.config/vicinae/themes`. Vicinae will recursively detect all `.json` files in that folder as new themes.

<Note>
If your theme does not appear in the list after adding it, running the Set Theme command will refresh the available themes.

## Vicinae Extra Themes

Vicinae should install a set of extra themes at the selected installation prefix.

You will usually find them at `/usr/share/vicinae/themes/`.

Note that user-defined themes (under `~/.local/share/vicinae` or `~/.config/vicinae`) will always have priority over system themes.
