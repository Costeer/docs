# Getting Started with Theming

Vicinae provides a theming system for customizing the appearance using TOML-based theme files.

<Note>
The current TOML-based theming system was introduced in v0.15.0, replacing the previous JSON-based format. If you have custom themes from before v0.15.0, you'll need to migrate them to the new format.

## What is a Vicinae Theme?

A Vicinae theme is a configuration file written in [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) that defines colors and metadata for the application's appearance. Themes support inheritance, hot reloading, and advanced color manipulation features.

Vicinae can also integrate with tools like [matugen](https://github.com/InioX/matugen) to automatically generate themes from wallpapers or images, creating cohesive color schemes across your entire system. See the [matugen integration guide](/theming/matugen) to learn how to set this up.

## Quick Start

To change your theme, use the built-in theme selector:

1. Open Vicinae's root search
2. Type "Set Theme" and select the command
3. Choose from the available themes

![Theme selector interface](/vicinae-set-theme.webp)

Alternatively, you can use the CLI:

```bash
vicinae theme set <theme_id>
```

The theme ID is the filename without the `.toml` extension.

## Creating Your First Theme

Generate a complete theme template with all available options:

```bash
vicinae theme template > ~/.local/share/vicinae/themes/my-new-theme.toml
```

Here's a minimal example:

```toml
[meta]
version = 1
name = "My Custom Theme"
description = "A personalized theme for Vicinae"
variant = "dark"
inherits = "vicinae-dark"

[colors.core]
background = "#1E1E2E"
foreground = "#CDD6F4"
accent = "#89B4FA"
```

## Theme Variants

Themes come in two variants:
- **dark** - For dark mode interfaces (inherits from `vicinae-dark`)
- **light** - For light mode interfaces (inherits from `vicinae-light`)

Every theme automatically inherits from its corresponding base theme (`vicinae-dark` or `vicinae-light`), so you only need to specify the colors you want to change.

## Next Steps

- Learn about [theme file structure](/theming/theme-structure) and available color options
- Explore [advanced features](/theming/advanced-features) like inheritance and color manipulation
- Discover [CLI tools](/theming/cli-tools) for managing and validating themes
