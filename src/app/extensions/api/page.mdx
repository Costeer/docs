# Extension API Reference

This page will host the complete API reference for the [@vicinae/api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vicinae/api?activeTab=readme) package used to develop extensions.

<Warning>
For now, we don't offer a proper API reference. You will have to rely on some of the [Raycast documentation](https://developers.raycast.com/api-reference/user-interface) (for what we implement), or the package typings directly (which are very much a work in progress at the moment).
</Warning>
