# Create a no-view command

In Vicinae, a no-view command is a command that directly executes from within the root search, without pushing new UI.

## Declaring a no-view command 

In order to declare a command as a no-view command, you need to set the `mode` of the command to `no-view` inside the manifest:

```json
{
  "name": "my-first-command",
  "title": "My First Command",
  "subtitle": "My first subtitle",
  "description": "My first command description",
  "mode": "no-view"
}
```

This command declaration expects the presence of a corresponding `src/my-first-command.ts` entrypoint file.

## No-View Lifecycle

When a no-view command is launched from the root search, the code inside the function starts executing immediately. 
The command is unloaded when the function returns **or** if another command is launched (as the command execution is non blocking).

<Warning>
no-view commands are not meant to execute long-running logic. As of now, we don't provide a way for extensions to do this outside of using external daemons (not recommended).
However, we will probably add something in the future.
</Warning>

## No-view command implementation

From the entrypoint, all you need to do is to export an async function as the default export:

```ts {{ title: 'my-first-command.tsx' }}
import { showToast } from '@vicinae/api';

export default async function MyFirstCommand() {
	await showToast({ title: 'Hello from no-view command!' });
}
```

<Note>
Make sure to properly `await` asynchronous API calls. Otherwise, the command might be unloaded before the promises resolve.
</Note>

<Warning>
Any attempt to use navigation features from no-view commands will be met with an error. You can, however, use other Vicinae APIs all the same.
