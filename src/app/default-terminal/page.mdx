# Set the Default Terminal

As there is no standardized way to set a default terminal emulator on a Linux desktop system, Vicinae honors the `x-scheme-handler/terminal` as some other launchers do.

To set your default terminal in this way, run:

```bash
xdg-mime default {desktop_file_name}.desktop x-scheme-handler/terminal
```

Where `{desktop_file_name}` is the name of the desktop file your application maps to.

For example, to set the default terminal to Alacritty:

```bash
xdg-mime default Alacritty.desktop x-scheme-handler/terminal
```
