This guide explains how to enable deeply integrate Viciane with your Gnome environment. {{ className: 'lead' }}

Gnome is supported via the <a href="https://github.com/dagimg-dot/vicinae-gnome-extension" target="_blank">Vicinae Gnome Extension</a> which provides the following features:

- Expose clipboard events through dbus
- Expose window managment APIs through dbus
- Blocking specific applications from accessing the clipboard (like password managers)
- Imitate the layer-shell protocol to create a detached floating launcher window which closes on focus loss
