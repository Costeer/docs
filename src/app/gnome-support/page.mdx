# Gnome Support

This guide explains how to enable deeply integrate Viciane with your Gnome environment. {{ className: 'lead' }}

Gnome is supported via the <a href="https://github.com/dagimg-dot/vicinae-gnome-extension" target="_blank">Vicinae Gnome Extension</a> which provides the following features:

- Expose clipboard events through dbus
- Expose window managment APIs through dbus
- Blocking specific applications from accessing the clipboard (like password managers)
- Imitate the layer-shell protocol to create a detached floating launcher window which closes on focus loss

## Extension Installation

1. Download the `.shell-extension.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/dagimg-dot/vicinae-gnome-extension/releases/latest)
2. Install using: `gnome-extensions install --force <filename>`
3. Enable the extension in GNOME Extensions app
4. Restart GNOME Shell or log out/in
5. Restart your vicinae server if it's running

## Feedback HUD and Gnome

Run vicinae server with the `VICINAE_DISABLE_HUD` environment variable set to 1 to disable notifications so that they don't grab focus since they are normal floating windows.

```bash
VICINAE_DISABLE_HUD=1 vicinae server
```

or add `Environment=VICINAE_DISABLE_HUD=1` to the `vicinae.service` file.
